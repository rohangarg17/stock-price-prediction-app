# stock-price-prediction-app
I am trying to create a general purpose Dash application to get future stock prices using various indicators for smart investment. I will be adding more indicators and refine the model. I will also like to extend the app to mutual funds and other indices.

For now the code takes in the historical data of a stock and using a simple regression model which predicts 5% data in future. I have created thu UI using Dash which is a perfect fit for the kind of app I am creating. It is purely for personal growth and maybe to get smarted investment strategies.
